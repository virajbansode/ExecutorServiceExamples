What is newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor?
Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor() creates a single-threaded scheduled executor. It runs tasks sequentially, one after the other, with support for delayed or periodic execution.

It is useful when you want to run scheduled tasks in a strict order, or when only one task should run at a time.


✅ Explanation
Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor():

Creates a scheduled executor with only one thread.

All tasks run one after the other, even if they're scheduled at the same time.

scheduler.schedule(task, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS):

Schedules the task to run once after a 2-second delay.

scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 1, 4, TimeUnit.SECONDS):

First runs the task after 1 second, then every 4 seconds.

Since there’s only one thread, if a task takes time to complete, the next run waits.

Shutdown after 15 seconds:

A task is scheduled to shutdown the executor service after 15 seconds using scheduler.shutdown().

✅ When to Use
Use newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor when:

You want sequential task execution.

Only one task should run at a time, even if others are waiting.

You want scheduled or periodic execution, but don’t need multiple threads.
